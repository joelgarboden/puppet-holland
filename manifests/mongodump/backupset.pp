# @summary Configures a mongodump backup set for Holland
#
# @param ensure
#   Should the backup set be installed or not.
#
# @param additional_options
#   Any additional options to the `mongodump` command-line utility these should
#   show up exactly as they are on the command line. e.g.: `'--gzip'`
#
# @param after_backup_command
#   Command to run after successful backup.
#
# @param authentication_database
#   The database the mongo user needs to authenticate against.
#
# @param auto_purge_failures
#   Specifies whether to keep a failed backup or to automatically remove the
#   backup directory. By default this is on with the intention that whatever
#   process is calling holland will retry when a backup fails. This behavior
#   can be disabled by setting `auto-purge-failures = no` when partial backups
#   might be useful or when troubleshooting a backup failure.
#
# @param backups_to_keep
#   Specifies the number of backups to keep for a backup-set.
#
# @param before_backup_command
#   Run a shell command before a backup starts.
#
# @param compress_inline
#   Whether or not to pipe the output of `mongodump` into the compression
#   utility. Enabling this is recommended since it usually only marginally
#   impacts performance, particularly when using a lower compression level.
#
# @param compression_level
#   What compression level to use. Lower numbers mean faster compression, though
#   also generally a worse compression ratio. Generally, levels 1-3 are
#   considered fairly fast and still offer good compression for textual data.
#   Levels above 7 can often cause a larger impact on the system due to needing
#   much more CPU resources. Setting the level to 0 effectively disables
#   compresion.
#
# @param compression_method
#   Which compression method to use. Note that lzop is not often installed by
#   default on many Linux distributions and may need to be installed separately.
#
# @param estimated_size_factor
#   Specifies the scale factor when Holland decides if there is enough free
#   space to perform a backup. This number is multiplied against what each
#   individual plugin reports its estimated backup size when Holland is
#   verifying sufficient free space for the backupset.
#
# @param failed_backup_command
#   Command to run after failed backup.
#
# @param host
#   Hostname for mongodump to connect with.
#
# @param password
#   Password for mongodump to authenticate with.
#
# @param purge_policy
#   Specifies when to run the purge routine on a backupset. By default this is
#   run after a new successful backup completes. Up to `backups_to_keep` backups
#   will be retained including the most recent.
#
#   `before-backup` will run the purge routine just before a new backup starts.
#   This will retain up to `backups_to_keep` backups before the new backup is
#   even started allowing purging all previous backups if `backups_to_keep` is
#   set to `0`. This behavior is useful if some other process is retaining
#   backups off-server and disk space is at a premium.
#
#   `manual` will never run the purge routine automatically. Either
#   `holland purge` must be run externally or an explicit removal of desired
#   backup directories can be done at some later time.
#
# @param username
#   Username for mongodump to authenticate with.
#
# @example Inherits from provider
#   include ::holland::mongodump
#
#   holland::mongodump::backupset { "localhost":
#     ensure                  => present,
