# provider for the [Holland Backup Manager](https://hollandbackup.org/)
#
# **Note**: This does not install the actual `mongodump` command since there
# are several different options for doing so. Especially with software
# collections.
#
# @summary Manage the mongodump provider for the Holland Backup Manager
#
# @param ensure
#   Should the plugin be installed or not.
#
# @param additional_options
#   Any additional options to the `mongodump` command-line utility these should
#   show up exactly as they are on the command line. e.g.: `'--gzip'`
#
# @param after_backup_command
#   Command to run after successful backup.
#
# @param authentication_database
#   The database the mongo user needs to authenticate against.
#
# @param before_backup_command
#   Run a shell command before a backup starts.
#
# @param compression_level
#   What compression level to use. Lower numbers mean faster compression, though
#   also generally a worse compression ratio. Generally, levels 1-3 are
#   considered fairly fast and still offer good compression for textual data.
#   Levels above 7 can often cause a larger impact on the system due to needing
#   much more CPU resources. Setting the level to 0 effectively disables
#   compresion.
#
# @param compression_method
#   Which compression method to use. Note that lzop is not often installed by
#   default on many Linux distributions and may need to be installed separately.
#
# @param failed_backup_command
#   Command to run after failed backup.
#
# @param host
#   Hostname for mongodump to connect with.
#
# @param password
#   Password for mongodump to authenticate with.
#
# @param username
#   Username for mongodump to authenticate with.
#
# @example Basic
#   include holland::mongodump
